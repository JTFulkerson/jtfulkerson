                <p>
                    I am a Computer Science student at The University of
                    Delware. In my free time you can find me working on personal
                    projects at a coffee shop or designing and manufacturing
                    something in UD's MakerGym. I am passionate about all things
                    tech-related and am always excited to tackle any project no
                    matter the size.

                <p>
                    Worked for Fairfax County Public Schools as a technician
                    managing event spaces and providing technical support. Was
                    mainly in charge of designing and executing sounds and
                    lights equipment however we I was also in charge of general
                    tech support or equipment rental setups.

                    During the COVID-19 pandemic, people were unable to travel
                    due to tight travel restrictions. However, a local tour
                    guide in Washington DC still wanted to share the beautiful
                    city with the world. Mary Beth Lane is a well known tour
                    guide for Washington DC. She reached out to me in hopes that
                    we could make virtual tours available for purchase,
                    showcasing the wonders of Washington DC. For this project, I
                    filmed, edited, and directed the tours currently available
                    online.

                    This project I worked for Lucia who is currently a student
                    at Holton-Arms School and decided that she wanted to educate
                    teenagers about specific career options in the medical
                    field. She chose to do this through a series of interviews
                    with medical professionals. Using my knowledge of sound
                    engineering and her medical field connections, we created
                    the podcast Talk2Lucia. I was in charge of recording,
                    editing and publishing the podcast using a portable
                    recording setup that I constructed.

                    In 2019 everything shut down due to the pandemic, however,
                    people still needed to practice their religion. Saint Luke
                    church reached out asking me to build a live steaming rig as
                    well as manage a weekly live stream. Of course, I said yes,
                    and this led to filming weddings, funerals, and even
                    baptisms. This gave me a wonderful opportunity to learn
                    management skills and it used my theatrical skills as well
                    to populate a rack full of gear to best suit the church's
                    needs. The majority of this was volunteer work, however
                    there were paid oppertunitys as well.
